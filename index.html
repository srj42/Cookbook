                <h3>    <!--Many college students fail to eat well rounded meals and would benefit from the use of a healthy cookbook. 
                        Eating well promotes immune system health and higher energy levels which impact the success of students. 
                        A poor diet puts students at risk of illness which will affect their ability to perform in school.-->
                        This college-friendly cookbook presents an array of recipes that are easy to follow and healthy. 
                        With busy schedules, college students do not prioritize their eating habits. 
                        With the help of this cookbook, these recipes promote healthy eating and boost their energy so they could focus on succeeding in school. 
                        The design intends for others to be inspired and add their own recipes to this cookbook that others can benefit from.
