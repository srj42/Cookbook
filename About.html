                            <li> We encourage anyone who would like to contribute a recipe to reach out to us.
                                 Our goal is to have a surplus of diverse meals that college students no matter the demographic can comfortably enjoy. 
                            </li>
                            <li> Keep in mind that the target audience for this cookbook is college students.
                                 Meals should be inexpensive, short in cooking time, and preparable with limited kitchen equipment. 
                            </li>
                            <li> This cookbook should always have a wide variety of meals. 
                                 Different kinds of meats are encouraged, as well as vegetarian and vegan options.
                            </li>
                            <li> Lastly, this cookbook is intended to only include healthy meals.
                                 College students often neglect their diet and in turn consume lots of sugar and saturated fats.
                                 The meals included here should be healthy options and limit the levels of unhealthy ingredients.
